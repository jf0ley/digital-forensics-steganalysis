# Digital Forensics & Steganalysis Project

This project explores techniques for data hiding and detection (steganography and steganalysis) using forensic analysis frameworks.

## ðŸ§  Overview
- Conducted experiments embedding and detecting hidden data with **OpenPuff**.  
- Followed digital forensic standards (**NIST 800-86**, **ISO/IEC 27043**).  
- Produced a detailed report analysing the effectiveness and limitations of steganalysis tools.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
OpenPuff â€¢ FTK Imager â€¢ Python â€¢ SHA-256 Hash Verification

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- Data hiding and extraction concepts.  
- Chain of custody & forensic documentation.  
- Investigative process under recognised forensic frameworks.
